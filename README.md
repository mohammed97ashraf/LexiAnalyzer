The REST API, built using Flask, offers a robust and efficient solution for handling your application's data and functionality. To enhance the API's documentation and improve its usability, Swagger was seamlessly integrated with Flask. With Swagger, developers can effortlessly explore, understand, and interact with the API, as it provides clear and comprehensive documentation. This combination of Flask and Swagger ensures a smooth development experience, empowering developers to build and interact with the API efficiently and effectively.

We have developed a user-friendly demo page that allows users to test the API before integrating it into their applications. This demo page is designed to cater to both developers who want to evaluate the API's functionality and any user who simply wants to determine the sentiment of a paragraph. By entering a paragraph of text into the demo page, users can easily obtain the sentiment analysis results in real time. This feature enables convenient and immediate access to the API's capabilities, making it accessible to a wide range of users with varying needs.
